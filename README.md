# 🧠 GroomAI — Your Personal Skincare & Grooming Advisor

## Why GroomAI Exists

Skincare advice today is **noisy, generic, and confusing**.

- People don’t know their **skin type** or real issues  
- Advice is scattered across influencers, ads, and trends  
- Asking others feels **awkward or uncomfortable**  
- Normal AI chats:
  - forget past context
  - don’t remember products you use
  - restart from zero every time  

Skincare is personal — advice usually isn’t.

**GroomAI was built to change that.**

## 🌱 What GroomAI Solves

GroomAI is a **private, personalized skincare & grooming advisor** that:

- Understands your **skin type & concerns**
- Remembers your **preferences and habits**
- Tracks products you already own
- Improves advice over time instead of resetting
- Feels safe, judgment-free, and consistent

It solves a small but very real problem most people quietly struggle with.
